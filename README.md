# ForkingPaths

ForkingPaths is an elixir module for the creation of cooccurrance graphs from texts. It consumes a vector of words, phrases or entities (for example the output from the [aleph-module](http://github.com/ggb/alpeh) as input. It then builds a cooccurrance graph and allows the application of different algorithms (at the moment degree, pagerank and hits) to get scores for the candidates. The output is a list of tuples where the first element is a candidate and the second the corresponding score.
